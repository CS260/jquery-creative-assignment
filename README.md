JQuery Creative Assignment

For this assignment, you should utilize your knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery to connect to a service using AJAX (You MUST connect to another service that you didn't create). Find something fun and create a new web page and prepare to present the page in class. You'll have a couple minutes (each) to present to a few other groups, and the top 5 in your class will present to the entire class. Make sure that your page doesn't require you to be there to explain it - because the TAs will be grading them without you there!

Do not copy another existing page! This is your chance to be creative and to work with another class member to do something phenomenal. If your project is simply an extension of a lab or a previous creative project, you will lose points.


** This assignment (and all creative projects) cannot be turned in late and need to be presented in class.**

You must submit to canvas the URL to your webpage (and make sure it is available from the due time until you have a grade), the URL to your github repository for this project, and a brief description about your creative usage of the technology(ies) required. This could include things you learned, issues you ran into (and overcame), or anything else you want to tell the TAs about your project. Make sure that your submitted URLs turn into links!

You must also put your project URL on the spreadsheet for class demo day:

You will be graded based off a combination of the following factors:

How well your project fits the scope of the description
How well you followed the instructions
A TA evaluation of your project
A small number of in-class peer evaluations (evaluations outside the in-class period will be discarded unless you talk to the TA)
